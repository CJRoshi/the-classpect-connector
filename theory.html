          <p className="mb-4">
            On October 29, 2025, Andrew Hussie answered an ask in the HSOD's{' '}
            <span className="discord-channel">#q-n-a</span> channel and showed us the canonical pairings and 
            more importantly, numeric activity levels for every single class. This uprooted tons of theory that 
            existed in the community, especially about how to interrelate classpects to one another.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            On that same day, duckBuster and myself both came up with different types of "inversion" where all the 
            classes, except the master classes, were divided into groups, and new types of relations could be made 
            between them. This concept later became the centerpiece of DB's new{' '}
            <a href="https://rosespecting.tumblr.com/post/792817810256560128/new-classpecting-guide" 
               target="_blank" 
               rel="noopener noreferrer"
               className="underline" 
               style={{color: '#0000ee'}}>
              classpecting guide
            </a>, at least when it comes to inversions-- for me, it forms the basis of a whole set of ways to pair 
            classpects with one another.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            Later on, bellCarved asked the question of "what if the Aspects had a scale of activity?", and then 
            "how might we assign that?" The result was a pairing of Classes to the Aspects based on the relatively 
            simple rule of assigning them based on "which class fits best?"
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            This creates two numeric scales-- one for classes, and one for aspects-- that is easily able to be manipulated 
            mathematically. Remember math? There's going to be a small amount of it here.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            At the same time, there are now four ways to relate one class to another-- the usual pair, the numeric 
            opposite, the relation me and DB discovered, and which I call an "antipair"-- and, as a natural extension 
            on the group theory-- the "quasipair".
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            With the combination of numeric theories and pair-based theories, I realized that it might be convenient 
            to not only build on both systems, but to also contribute new ideas, like rotation. (Just imagine rotating 
            the classpects in your mind...)
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">And so, I present to you:</p>
          
          <h1 className="font-typostuck-title text-center my-8">
            Classpecting: Graphs, Rotations, and Groups

        {/* Part 1: Pair Theories */}
        <div id="part1" className="pt-6">
          <h2 className="font-typostuck-header mb-4">Part 1: Pair Theories</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            The first thing that I should explain is also the oldest-- it's the pair theory.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            So, let's start at the beginning, with the image posted by Hussie:
          </p>
          
          <div className="text-center my-6">
            <img src="./images/figures/normalpairs.png" alt="Normal Pairs" style={{maxHeight: '400px', margin: '0 auto'}} />
          </div>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            What you see here is a list from -7 to +7 of all the classes, alongside bars connecting them. Calliope's 
            pairs are here and correct, while the pairs people were most unsure of-- Witch, Sylph, Maid, and Heir-- were 
            confirmed to be dual active and dual passive respectively by this post.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            We started playing with this image immediately. In my head, I always found that Homestuck, and later Beyond 
            Canon, was trying to say something about Princes and Seers-- not only with Rose being compared and contrasted 
            to Eridan, and later with Dirk, but also in the ways that Rose and Terezi interact with Dirk on Deltritus.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            What I realized was that you could do the following to this list. Ignoring Lord and Muse, because nothing 
            fills out their set of four, you can take the list, and fold it in half, like this:
          </p>
          
          <div className="text-center my-6">
            <img src="./images/figures/antipairs_noconnections.png" alt="Antipairs without connections" style={{maxHeight: '400px', margin: '0 auto'}} />
          </div>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            Then, you start drawing diagonals all the way across, like so:
          </p>
          
          <div className="text-center my-6">
            <img src="./images/figures/antipairs.png" alt="Antipairs" style={{maxHeight: '400px', margin: '0 auto'}} />
          </div>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            This creates the following sets of Antipairs, divided into three groups:
          </p>
          
          <ul className="list-none ml-6 mb-4">
            <li className="mb-2"><strong>Group 1 (outermost):</strong> Witch/Maid and Sylph/Heir</li>
            <li className="mb-2"><strong>Group 2 (in-between):</strong> Prince/Seer and Mage/Bard</li>
            <li className="mb-2"><strong>Group 3 (central):</strong> Thief/Page and Knight/Rogue</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            Obviously, with the appearance of so many "obvious bait" inversions here, I felt I had to go further, so 
            I attached a small myth and a name to each of these groups.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4 ml-8" style={{fontSize: '0.95rem'}}>
            <strong>Group 1,</strong> I dubbed the <strong>Magic Group</strong>. I did this because it reminds me so much of Cinderella 
            and Snow White, as old as those films may be-- the notion of "true inheritance" to a kingdom (Heirs), of 
            fairies in a forest (Sylphs), Witches that might not be all too bad, and downtrodden Maids given a chance 
            to shine. I also call this group the <strong>Rulebreaker Group</strong> because of the fact that it contains the Dual Actives 
            and Passives-- a major motivating factor for the assignment of Aspects to Classes down the line.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4 ml-8" style={{fontSize: '0.95rem'}}>
            <strong>Group 2,</strong> I called the <strong>Vizier's Group</strong>. This is because all four members of the group can 
            serve a role of advising a monarch. Princes and Bards are the more "powerful" in that their words more 
            easily rouse a monarch to action, but Mages and Seers are equally important in introducing new angles to 
            an issue. In other words: all of them can be the scheming eunuch, if they want.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4 ml-8" style={{fontSize: '0.95rem'}}>
            <strong>Group 3</strong> is the <strong>Laws and Outlaws Group</strong>. This one is, I think, self-evident-- Knights and 
            Pages are the "Law" side and Rogues and Thieves form the "Outlaw" side. All can have noble-- or ignoble-- intentions, 
            regardless of what side of the law they stand on. One imagines a Rapacious Knight, too gallant for their own 
            good, or a noble Rogue who takes from the rich and gives to the poor.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            This obviously leaves Lord and Muse stranded. What's their relation to one another? Right now, they are both 
            their own Pairs and Antipairs, and also their own Quasipairs. Were there to be a class of zero value, like 
            the Waste, both would be Quasipaired with it, but such a Class does not exist. If it ever gets canonized, 
            I'm updating this post.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            On that note, we may well discuss the notion of Quasipairs. BC actually developed these independently of me, 
            but it turns out that they are well covered by asking the question of "which Class in my group is not covered 
            by neither my Pair, nor my Antipair?" BC is also responsible for this lovely diagram illustrating the idea.
          </p>
          
          <div className="text-center my-6">
            <img src="./images/figures/quasipairs.png" alt="Quasipairs" style={{maxHeight: '400px', margin: '0 auto'}} />
          </div>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            And as expected, this is exactly consistent with the above-- it's the class that is "left out".
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            What does this mean? Yes, that's a good question. The real answer is "I don't know yet," but certainly we 
            can ascribe some meaning here!
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">My take is this:</p>
          
          <p className="quote-indent mb-4">
            "While you generally act alike to all the Classes in your group, you act most similarly to your Pair and 
            Quasipair and least similarly to the Antipair."
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            Seems noncommittal, I get it, but there's no real way to account for the nuance of human experience without 
            sounding at least a bit noncommittal. Other people have dug into this idea much more than I have, and I 
            recommend you sink your teeth into their ideas too, because a lot of them are really good.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">"Do you have examples?"</p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            I do. I like to think of Jade, June, Kanaya, and Aradia for the Magic Group-- that's what I'll use here.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4 ml-8" style={{fontSize: '0.95rem'}}>
            Jade and Kanaya are paired; June and Aradia are paired. In general, one notices that they have somewhat 
            inverted arcs when it comes to personal freedom-- Jade and Kanaya start happy and free but begin to become 
            burdened with Space-related duties over time, while June and Aradia start off overburdened and become 
            somewhat freer and happier as the plot progresses or as time rolls on, respectively. Jade and June are 
            quasipaired-- it is no secret that they act similar to one another, especially when you factor in them being 
            ecto-siblings. Similarly, Aradia and Kanaya both have a similarly pleasant (if sometimes macabre) tone and 
            sense of humor. These are general observations, but I think you get the idea-- June acts least like Kanaya 
            and Jade acts least like Aradia in this group of four, and vice versa.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            You could keep going, but I don't want to lengthen an already long section-- other ideas and interpretations 
            are up to you to decide. I am just giving you the tools.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">And now, the crappy segue into:</p>
        </div>
        
        {/* Part 2: Aspect Activity */}
        <div id="part2" className="pt-6">
          <h2 className="font-typostuck-header mb-4">Part 2: Aspect Activity</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            This was actually not that hard to do, at least for me and BC. The question was pretty simple:
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">"Which Class behaves most like each Aspect?"</p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">The following are our answers:</p>
          
          <div className="text-center my-6">
            <img src="./images/figures/activityscale_extended.png" alt="Activity Scale Extended" style={{maxHeight: '600px', margin: '0 auto'}} />
          </div>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            I'd like to go through and explain these, not necessarily in order.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4 ml-8" style={{fontSize: '0.95rem'}}>
            <strong>Heir of Space</strong> was perhaps the most obvious assignment of all. Hussie describes Heirs as 
            "making room for their Aspect to fill" with June, and Space is literally "that room". I can't think of 
            anything more natural than an Heir inheriting an estate.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4 ml-8" style={{fontSize: '0.95rem'}}>
            <strong>Thief of Life</strong> is another obvious one--  even without the context of Meenah, a thief typically 
            takes wealth and sometimes power-- all symbols of Life as an Aspect.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4 ml-8" style={{fontSize: '0.95rem'}}>
            <strong>Bard of Void</strong> makes sense when one considers the way in which Bards put on performances or 
            even "airs of madness", if you buy into the Shakespearean idea.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4 ml-8" style={{fontSize: '0.95rem'}}>
            <strong>Hope</strong> was placed at the very top because it seems to overpower basically every other Aspect, 
            and the moments in which it is used (Jake's hopesplosions, Eridan's use of "wwhite science") are all extremely 
            active no matter the class. They also overpower Space on both occasions. You know, the Aspect that is said to 
            "collapse in on itself, taking all else with it"? So, it makes sense that a Witch of Space might be constantly 
            stymied (by Vriska, by Alt!Calliope), while a Witch of Hope is much more permitted to act. Active Class with 
            active Aspect versus active Class with passive Aspect.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4 ml-8" style={{fontSize: '0.95rem'}}>
            <strong>Seer of Blood</strong> and <strong>Mage of Breath</strong> are both linked to this idea of connections 
            and flows-- in other words, the classes that deal with knowledge make a lot of connections. Kankri being here 
            becomes less surprising in light of this thought. Also, blood flow is passive and involuntary, while breathing 
            can be controlled; that's part of how we decided active/passive here.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4 ml-8" style={{fontSize: '0.95rem'}}>
            <strong>Knight of Mind</strong> was found through this idea of "stress"-- something BC and I use as part of 
            describing Knights-- in that Knights are often put under stress while dealing with the siege on their Aspect, 
            and Mind has a lot to do with making choices under pressure (think [S] Flip). This creates Latula, who 
            exhibits the strongest example of a Knightly facade perhaps ever.

            <strong>Maid of Time</strong> makes sense when you think about Time for a while-- Time is ultimately a passive 
            force, only becoming "violent" when one is poorly prepared for it, at least in my view. That Homestuck also 
            has this immutable Alpha Timeline doesn't exactly scream "active"-- everything seems preplanned. Compare and 
            contrast Dave with Doc Scratch here, how Dave is under constant pressure while Doc Scratch has everything 
            planned and acts calmly. Aradia exhibits both behaviors. Time players are fundamentally always preparing for 
            the future-- Maids, in general, accommodate or prepare for their Aspect in the same way an Heir does, but more 
            actively, of course.

            At this point, the gaps can be filled in using the pairs-- most of them make a lot of sense. For Rogue of Doom, 
            here's a freebie. Remember that Life is often associated with the upper class. Rogues work in support of the 
            lower class-- Doom by extension. (Thank you Fazzie for phrasing it this way, genuinely enlightening.)

            Now certainly, you can imagine applying this to EVERY classpect, but WHAT does any of it mean? That's a 
            very good question.

          <p className="mb-4 ml-8" style={{fontSize: '0.95rem'}}>
            The <strong>Pairs</strong> are very "I dunno". Numeric-Numeric is a Guaranteed Shadow, so I'll talk about it more. I'll 
            be frank when I say this is the dying gasp of old inversion theory into relation-theory like what I am 
            doing right now. Some of this might be good for setting up "classical foils", where you want two characters 
            to examine different themes, or maybe the same theme from a different view. If you're like me and think 
            Kris Dreemurr is a Maid of Blood, then the obvious pairwise inversion to an Heir of Breath-- June Egbert-- could 
            not make it clearer that I think both protagonists are kind of examining some similar themes, especially 
            when it comes to "narratives" and how we interact with them.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4 ml-8" style={{fontSize: '0.95rem'}}>
            <strong>Siblings.</strong> This is my favorite part of this whole thing. My belief is that in your strongest 
            moments, you can act a lot like a sibling classpect. The example I gave is{' '}
            <a href="./index.html#/classpect/seer-of-mind" className="underline" style={{color: '#0000ee'}}>
              Terezi
            </a>, who has the siblings of 
            Mage of Time, Prince of Doom, and Bard of Hope. Before Flip, we see Terezi peering into and being solely 
            burdened with the knowledge of alternate timelines-- by the time of Remem8er, Terezi is also burdened by NOT 
            knowing alternate timelines. These both seem pretty clearly like Mage of Time tendencies (speaking from some 
            experience {'>'}{':'}3). And then there's the retcon, wherein Terezi 
            clearly acts like a Bard of Hope, if you didn't have context of her being a Mind player. Terezi directly 
            invites June to destroy the current timeline in exchange for a newer one with brighter hopes, perfectly 
            fitting the role. Also, funnily enough, we know that Jake hopesplodes in GAME OVER, while in the new 
            timeline, he does not do that-- the Hope player was made weaker, indirectly due to Terezi's influence. Isn't 
            this fun? Tell me how this isn't fun.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4 ml-8" style={{fontSize: '0.95rem'}}>
            <strong>Shadows.</strong> These are the classpects you act like while you are at your worst (and vice versa, 
            they act like you at their worst). Consider Jake. One of his shadows is a Rogue of Rage. It is not hard to 
            see how Jake at his worst engenders anger in others while being totally pacified himself, mostly due to him 
            being a blockhead. The numeric inverse is guaranteed to be one of these, so it's important to remember it.

            Okay. This is where the real math begins. So, I want you to imagine the{' '}

              Sylph of Light
            </a>, as a classpect. Now that we have two numeric scales, we can place this classpect on a Cartesian 
            grid-- the point (-1, -5). We can also place the reflective inverse-- swapping Class and Aspect-- here too. 
            This is the Prince of Rage, (-5, -1).

          <p className="mb-4">
            Now, I want you to consider applying the standard rotation operator to this. "What's that?" I mean this 
            vector operator:
          </p>
          
          <div className="text-center my-6">

            Because there are 12 Aspects, all spaced at thirty degrees from one another, the natural choice is to 
            calculate a rotated classpect every thirty degrees. Because this can yield noninteger or otherwise invalid 
            results, what I do is this:
          </p>
          
          <ul className="list-none ml-6 mb-4">
            <li className="mb-2">
              Are the values noninteger?
              <ul className="list-none ml-6">
                <li>If so, round X, Y to the nearest integer-valued point.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li className="mb-2">
              Is the classpect invalid? Is X or Y too large, or is one of them zero?
              <ul className="list-none ml-6">
                <li>If so, don't display it.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li className="mb-2">
              Are there duplicates?
              <ul className="list-none ml-6">
                <li>If so, don't display it.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p className="mb-4">For Aranea's classpect, you get this:</p>
          
          <div className="text-center my-6">
            <img src="./images/figures/aranearotations.png" alt="Aranea Rotations" style={{maxHeight: '400px', margin: '0 auto'}} />

          <p className="mb-4">Thankfully, all the rotations are valid.</p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            Examining this circle is fun-- on it, there is a Bard of Rage, at 90 degrees to Aranea, and a Seer of Light, 
            sandwiched between. There are a few ways to interpret all of this. What I generally have taken away from 
            rotation theory is that a difference of less than 90 degrees implies some similarity of action while a 
            difference of more than that implies some difference. In other words, Rose can sometimes act similar to 
            Aranea and Gamzee (the latter is less obvious, but I want you to compare Rose observing events through the 
            crystal ball and Gamzee observing the Critical Moment), while Rose probably acts nothing alike to a Page 
            of Doom or Thief of Heart.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            Some other examinations lend themselves to humor. For example, Kankri and Dave lie on the same circle at a 
            120-degree difference. Unsurprisingly, both make an absurd amount of red text on the screen. Kanaya and June 
            also lie at 120 degrees from one another. This one's a reach, but I want to say it's because both of them 
            used made-up meters for things? (Prankster's Gambit, Flighty Broads and Their Snarky Horseshitometer?) Again, 
            the ball is in your court now. Go wild with interpretation.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            Reflection, or the Reflective Inverse, is tough to interpret. Certainly, Kurloz and Aranea both did weird 
            and bad things, but they did it differently-- Aranea in a Lighty way, out in the open, and Kurloz in a Ragey 
            way, secretly and frustratingly. They also did it for different people-- Aranea acts against Lord English, 
            while Kurloz does what he does in support of the same. After diving deep into it, the pattern I see is that 
            your reflective inverse is a very good "foil" to the original classpect.

            you want to? At the end of the day, this is classpecting. It's not all too serious. But it's a fun theory, 
            and it's still pretty open to interpretation and exploration, so go wild with it! If you want to dive deeper,

            having trouble figuring out a character; the idea of siblings, or shadows, or rotations, can be very useful
